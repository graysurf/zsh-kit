# zsh-kit

A modular, self-contained Zsh environment focused on manual control, clean structure, and script-based extensibility — with emoji-powered UX and built-in Git tools.

## ✨ Core Features

> This Zsh environment provides a clean structure and several built-in tools.

- 🌟 [Login banner](docs/guides/login-banner.md): Emoji-powered shell intro with rotating quotes
- 🧩 [Plugin System](docs/guides/plugin-system.md): Git-powered declarative loader with auto-clone and update support
- ⏳ [Progress bar utilities](docs/guides/progress-bar.md): TTY-friendly progress output for long-running commands
- 🚀 [Starship](https://starship.rs): Customized prompt with language & context awareness
- 🧭 [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide): Smart directory jumping, aliased as `z`
- 🔧 Modular and lazy-friendly structure under `scripts/`
- 🧹 Centralized `cache/` and `.private/` folders for clean separation of history, state, and secrets

## 🛠 Built-in CLI Tools

> The following tools are developed as part of this environment and tightly integrated.
> Each has a dedicated documentation file and serves a focused task in the Git or shell workflow.

- 🔗 [git-open](docs/cli/git-open.md): Open repo/branch/commit/PR pages in browser
- 🔐 [git-lock](docs/cli/git-lock.md): Commit locking system for safe checkpoints, diffs, and tagging
- 🧰 [git-tools](docs/cli/git-tools.md): Grouped git helper router (reset/commit/branch/utils)
- 📊 [git-summary](docs/cli/git-summary.md): Author-based contribution stats over time ranges
- 🤖 [Codex CLI helpers](docs/cli/codex-cli-helpers.md): Codex feature integration (expects native `codex-tools`)
- 🧠 [OpenCode CLI helpers](docs/cli/opencode-cli-helpers.md): Opt-in OpenCode prompt wrappers (feature: `opencode`)
- 🐳 [docker-tools](docs/cli/docker-tools.md): Opt-in Docker helpers (feature: `docker`)

## 🧩 Native CLI tool integrations (external)

These commands are expected to be installed separately (native binaries) and are integrated by this
repo via aliases and optional completion wiring:

- 🔎 [fzf-tools](docs/cli/fzf-tools.md): Native fuzzy-driven launcher (legacy Zsh implementation archived)
- 📂 [git-scope](docs/cli/git-scope.md): Native tree-based viewers (legacy Zsh implementation archived)

## 🪄 Startup Snapshot

> Login messages include randomly selected inspirational quotes and an optional cached wttr.in weather snapshot, stored in local files that grow over time.

An example Zsh startup log with this config:

```text
Weather report: Taipei City, Taiwan

      (   ).    +13(12) °C
     (___(__)   ↙ 13 km/h
      ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘   10 km
     ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘    0.7 mm

To show a one-line feature summary at startup, set:

```bash
export ZSH_BOOT_FEATURES_ENABLED=true
```

## Setup

This repo is designed to be used as your Zsh config directory via `ZDOTDIR`.

In your `~/.zshenv`, set the custom config location **and explicitly source** this repo’s `.zshenv`:

```bash
export ZDOTDIR="$HOME/.config/zsh"
if [[ -r "$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv" ]]; then
  source "$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv"
fi
```

### Optional Features (`ZSH_FEATURES`)

Some modules are disabled by default (not sourced; no wrappers generated).
Enable them by setting `ZSH_FEATURES` in your **home** `~/.zshenv` **before** sourcing this repo:

```bash
export ZSH_FEATURES="codex,opencode"
```

Current features:

- `codex`: enables codex integration helpers and `codex-starship` (expects native `codex-tools`)
- `codex-workspace`: enables `codex-workspace` helpers (plus `codex-workspace` completion)
- `opencode`: enables `opencode-tools` (plus `opencode-tools` completion)
- `docker`: enables `docker-tools` + `docker-aliases` (plus `docker-tools` + `docker` completion)

Why the extra `source`? `.zshenv` is the first startup file, so setting `ZDOTDIR` inside `~/.zshenv`
does not automatically make Zsh restart and load `$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv`.

Zsh will now load:

- `$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv` for all shells
- `$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile` for login shells
- `$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc` for interactive shells

For more details, see: [docs/guides/startup-files.md](docs/guides/startup-files.md).

Make sure that `.zshrc` sources the bootstrap loader:

```bash
source "$ZDOTDIR/bootstrap/bootstrap.zsh"
```

This will initialize all scripts in proper order via the `load_script_group_ordered()` / `load_script_group()` loader helpers.

> 🧰 This setup expects you to have your favorite CLI tools installed.  
> It won't hand-hold you, and assumes tools like `eza`, `tree`, `bat`, or `fzf` are already available.  
> If something errors out, you're probably just missing a binary — install and carry on.  

## Philosophy

No magic. Fully reproducible.  
Modular by design, manual by default.

## 🧑‍💻 Why I Made This

This setup is the result of many hours spent refining my shell environment.  
It includes several tools I built myself—some small, some extensive.  
Among them, [git-magic](scripts/git/git-magic.zsh) remains my favorite and most-used.  

If there’s something you use every day, it’s worth taking the time to make it yours.
