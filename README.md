# zsh-kit

A modular, self-contained Zsh environment focused on manual control, clean structure, and script-based extensibility — with emoji-powered UX and built-in Git tools.

## ✨ Core Features

> This Zsh environment provides a clean structure and several built-in tools.

- 🌟 [Login banner](docs/login-banner.md): Emoji-powered shell intro with rotating quotes
- 🧩 [plugin-system](docs/plugin-system.md): Git-powered declarative loader with auto-clone and update support
- 🚀 Customized [Starship](https://starship.rs) prompt with language & context awareness
- 🧭 Smart directory jumping with [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide), aliased as `z`
- 🔧 Modular and lazy-friendly structure under `scripts/`
- 🧹 Centralized `cache/` and `.private/` folders for clean separation of history, state, and secrets

## 🛠 Built-in CLI Tools

> The following tools are developed as part of this environment and tightly integrated.
> Each has a dedicated documentation file and serves a focused task in the Git or shell workflow.

- 🔐 [git-lock](docs/git-lock.md): Commit locking system for safe checkpoints, diffs, and tagging
- 📂 [git-scope](docs/git-scope.md): Tree-based visualizations of tracked, staged, modified, or untracked files
- 📊 [git-summary](docs/git-summary.md): Author-based contribution stats over time ranges
- 🔎 [fzf-tools](docs/fzf-tools.md): Interactive fuzzy-driven launcher for files, Git, processes, and history

## 🪄 Startup Snapshot

> Login messages include randomly selected inspirational quotes and an optional cached wttr.in weather snapshot, stored in local files that grow over time.

An example Zsh startup log with this config:

```text

## Setup

In your `~/.zshenv`, define the custom config location:

```bash
export ZDOTDIR="$HOME/.config/zsh"
```

Zsh will now source your config from `$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc`.

Make sure that `.zshrc` begins by sourcing the env and plugin setup:

```bash
source "$ZDOTDIR/bootstrap/bootstrap.sh"
```

This will initialize all scripts in proper order via the `load_script_group()` system.

## 🛠 Notes

To enable quote display on login, make sure to create the following file manually:

```bash
mkdir -p $ZDOTDIR/assets
touch $ZDOTDIR/assets/quotes.txt
```

This file is **not tracked by Git** and will be automatically appended with quotes over time.  
If it does not exist, the system will fall back to a default quote.

> 🧰 This setup expects you to have your favorite CLI tools installed.  
> It won't hand-hold you, and assumes tools like `eza`, `tree`, `bat`, or `fzf` are already available.  
> If something errors out, you're probably just missing a binary — install and carry on.  

## Philosophy

No magic. Fully reproducible.  
Modular by design, manual by default.

## 🧑‍💻 Why I Made This

This setup is the result of many hours spent refining my shell environment.  
It includes several tools I built myself—some small, some extensive.  
Among them, [git-magic](scripts/git/git-magic.sh) remains my favorite and most-used.  

If there’s something you use every day, it’s worth taking the time to make it yours.
